# Rust Crash Course Jupyter Notebooks

This is a series of [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks serving as a
crash course, i.e. a compact and straight-forward introduction, for the
[Rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org/). This might be
especially useful for interactive Rust introduction sessions, e.g. in
university education.

## Requirements

The provided notebooks require three components for correct operation:

 * Rust
 * Jupyter Notebook Server
 * EvCxR Jupyter Kernel

### Rust

Rust can be installed by the [``rustup`` tool](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started)
provided on the official [Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

### Jupyter Notebook Server

There are several ways to install a Jupyter notebook environment on your system.

Some are shown on the official [Jupyter project website](https://jupyter.org/).

Also, common Linux distributions like Ubuntu provide dedicated packages, e.g.:
```sh
sudo apt install jupyter-notebook
```

### EvCxR Jupyter Kernel

Follow the installation instructions provided by the developers of the
[EvCxR Jupyter kernel](https://github.com/google/evcxr/tree/master/evcxr_jupyter).

## License

The notebooks are licensed under either of

 * [Apache License, Version 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)
 * [MIT license](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

at your option.
