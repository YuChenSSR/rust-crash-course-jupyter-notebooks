    "The linter in ``rustc`` implements five lint levels. Each lint has a default level and the compiler itself has a default warning level. The five lint levels are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ``allow``        (produces no output)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. ``warn``         (produces a warning)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. ``force-warn``   (produces a warning)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. ``deny``         (produces an error)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. ``forbid``       (produces an error)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Lints with the level ``allow``, ``warn``, and ``deny`` can be overridden with a macro command (just like ``#![deny(missing_docs)]``).\n",
    "The lints ``force-warn`` and ``forbid`` behave like ``warn`` and ``deny``, respectively, but they cannot be overridden.\n",
